<h3>Target audience:</h3>
 The targeted audience for this website is those living in or visiting the 3 towns that will be displayed on the site. 
 <br>
<h3>Two Personas:</h3><br>

The first person is Jane, a mom with young kids. She is familiar with technology and regularly checks the weather to know whether or not she can take <br>
her kids to the park or on other outdoor adventures. She usually looks on the weather app on her phone, but wants information more pertinent to  <br>
her exact town besides just the weather, without having to search multiple sources. 
<br>

The second person is Gerald, a 65 year old man who checks the weather daily, but uses his computer to do so. He is not very familiar with technology<br>
and wants to be able to see the forecast and other local events without having to navigate through a bunch of confusing web pages.
