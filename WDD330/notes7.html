    <ul><h2> Ch 11: Further Functions</h2>
        <h3>Function properties and methods</h3>
       <li>call() method - set the value of <i>this</i>> inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument</li>
       <li>if function does not use <i>this</i> in body, call() method must have <i>null</i> as first argument i.e. function.call(null, 5)</li>
       <li><u>Custom properties</u><br>
        - description (i.e. function.description) allows you to describe what function does <br>
        - memoization - saves result in cache property to be used again later (i.e. function.cache) <br>
        
    </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Immediately Invoked function expressions</h3>
       <li>function invokes as soon as defined. Use parenthesis at end of function 
        i.e. <br>
        (function(){ const cat = 'Tabby'; console.log(`Cute ${cat}`);})();
    </li>
    <li>to use strict mode, place all code in IIFE (especially if collaborating with others) and use strict mode within that</li>
    <li>allows you to write blocks of code that don't interfere with each other</li>
    </ul>
   
    <ul>
        <h3>Recursive functions</h3>
       <li>invokes itself until condition is met</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Callbacks</h3>
       <li>functions passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they are passed to</li>
       <li>too many callbacks can create messy, confusing code</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Promises</h3>
       <li>represent the future result of an asynchronous operation</li>
       <li>help simplify process when multiple callbacks used to avoid messy, confusing code</li>
       <li>Life cycle: <br>
        - pending - when promise calls asynchronous operation <br>
        - unsettled - stage where operation is taking place <br>
        - settled - operation has been completed. <u>Outcomes of this can be:</u> <br>
        - Resolved - asynchronous operation successfully completed<br>
        - Rejected - asynchronous operation <i>not</i> successfully completed<br>
       </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Async functions</h3>
       <li>preceded by asynch keyword i.e. async function()</li>
       <li>write async code as if it was synchronous </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Functions that return functions</h3>
       <li>just like using callbacks, functions can return other functions</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Closures</h3>
       <li>inner function returned by outer function allowing access to variables declared in enclosing function</li>
    </ul>

<ul><h2> Ch 13: AJAX</h2>
<li>AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</li>
<li>Fetch API - used for sending/receiving data async across network. Uses promises to avoid callback issues</li>
</ul>
